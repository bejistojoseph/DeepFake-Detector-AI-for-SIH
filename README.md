## Deep Fake Detection: Face-Swap Authentication

### Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for detecting and authenticating face-swap deep fake videos using advanced AI/ML techniques. Deep fakes, synthetically generated audios and videos, have become increasingly prevalent due to advancements in AI, specifically in Generative AI and Large Language Models. While these innovations captivate tech enthusiasts, they also pose significant risks, including political disruption, fraud, disinformation, and non-consensual content creation. Recent instances have shown deep fakes being maliciously used to defame individuals. Consequently, detecting and identifying deep fakes has become a critical challenge for security agencies worldwide.

This project aims to develop a forensic technique to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos, where a person's facial identity is replaced with another's. The solution leverages a multi-pronged approach involving various AI/ML methods to detect deep fakes with high accuracy.

### Features

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Detect inconsistencies in facial features, expressions, and movements by analyzing video frames for unnatural transitions and discrepancies.
  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:** Analyze the sequence of frames in a video to identify temporal anomalies and inconsistencies indicative of deep fakes.

- **Capsule Networks:** Identify discrepancies in facial pose and texture.

- **Adversarial Training:** Utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate deep fakes and simultaneously train a model to detect them, improving the robustness of detection algorithms.

- **Audio-Visual Inconsistencies:** Detect mismatches between lip movements and speech or inconsistencies in ambient sounds by combining audio and visual analysis.

- **Blockchain Technology:** Implement blockchain to create immutable records of media, providing a verifiable chain of custody for digital content to ensure its authenticity.

- **Frequency Analysis:** Analyze the frequency domain of images and videos to detect anomalies and artifacts introduced during the deep fake creation process.

- **Biometric Verification:** Analyze subtle behavioral traits such as micro-expressions, eye, and head movement to detect anomalies.

- **Hybrid Models:** Combine spatial, temporal, audio, and frequency analysis to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep fake detection.

### Expected Outcome

The solution will analyze a given video suspected of being a deep fake and produce a detailed report on various characteristics of the deep fake. The report will include:

- **Confirmation of Fake:** Indication of whether the video is confirmed as a deep fake.
- **Details of Abnormalities:** Specific abnormalities observed in the video.
- **Mathematical Techniques:** Explanation of the underlying techniques used to create the deep fake.

### Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To use the deep fake detection system:

1. **Input Video:** Provide the video suspected of being a deep fake.
2. **Run Detection:** Execute the detection script to analyze the video.
3. **Output Report:** The system will generate a detailed report on the authenticity of the video.

```bash
python detect_deepfake.py --input <path_to_video> --output <path_to_report>
```
